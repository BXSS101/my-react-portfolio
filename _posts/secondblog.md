# TrueID Connect

Are you curious about the creative process that goes into developing a successful project? Join me on a journey as I share my experience working on **TrueID Connect** during my time at the **True Academy** Internship Program 2022.

True Academy is an internship program that offers students from diverse academic backgrounds the opportunity to collaborate on their own projects and partner with a selected business unit within the company. During my two-month internship at True Academy, my team collaborated with the Corporate Strategy unit to explore ways to make the TrueID application more accessible and engaging. We identified an opportunity to create a social platform where users can discuss content from the app and other topics, and also proposed a redesign of the app to focus on entertainment content.

## EP.1 Understanding Users

During our user research, we discovered that while the TrueID app offered a plethora of features, not all users found them equally useful or easy to navigate. Some users found the app overwhelming due to the abundance of features, making it difficult for them to find what they were looking for. For example, the screenshot showed a cluttered page with numerous buttons, and most users had to scroll at least once to reach the content shelf.
Here are some feedback from our survey and research â†“

> Buttons should be easier to navigate.
---
> There is better platform for streaming content.
---
> App should improve reliability.

Once we had identified the pain points experienced by our users, we set our project goals. Our primary objective was to address the lack of a community feature within the app, providing users with a space to engage with others who share their interests. Our secondary goal was to enhance the app's usability, making it easier for users to navigate and locate the features they need.

## EP.2 Our Goal & Idea
One of our primary goals was to incorporate a community function that allows users to watch content from the app together with their friends, similar to screen sharing features in platforms like Google Meet or Discord. However, it is important to emphasize that we will ensure that this feature is implemented in a legal and appropriate manner.
![KeyFeatureLofi](https://github.com/BXSS101/my-react-portfolio/blob/main/photo/TrueID/lofi_newfeat.jpg?raw=true)
To achieve our first goal, we developed an idea called "Watch Party," which allows users to watch content together with their friends, similar to screen-sharing in platforms like Google Meet or Discord. Our team decided to rename this feature from "Watch Room" to "Watch Party," as we felt the latter sounded more appropriate. We believe that this feature will significantly increase user engagement and encourage more users to subscribe to the app, ultimately benefiting the company. Additionally, we also developed a feature called "Movie Mix," which will enable users to discover new content and watch it with their friends in a social setting.

Our **Watch Party** feature allows users to watch content together in a private room with friends or join public rooms with many people. This feature provides more opportunities for influencer-led events and enhances user engagement. It works similarly to live chat, but with more customization options and features. With Watch Party, we expect to increase monthly active users and provide a more interactive and enjoyable experience for our users.

The **Movie Mix** feature is designed to match users with others who share the same movie genre interests. By recommending movies based on those interests, users can discover new movies to try. Additionally, Movie Mix creates a community forum where users can communicate and discuss their shared interests. This feature enhances user engagement and encourages community building within the app.

## EP.3 Design

Will those feature work?, Does user like it?, How it will be improve?

To be continue.

Spoiler Alert! I got top performer award from my internship.
