# TrueID Connect

Are you curious about the creative process that goes into developing a successful project? Join me on a journey as I share my experience working on **TrueID Connect** during my time at the **True Academy** Internship Program 2022.

True Academy is an internship program that offers students from diverse academic backgrounds the opportunity to collaborate on their own projects and partner with a selected business unit within the company. During my two-month internship at True Academy, my team collaborated with the Corporate Strategy unit to explore ways to make the TrueID application more accessible and engaging. We identified an opportunity to create a social platform where users can discuss content from the app and other topics, and also proposed a redesign of the app to focus on entertainment content.

## EP.1 Understanding Users

During our user research, we discovered that while the TrueID app offered a plethora of features, not all users found them equally useful or easy to navigate. Some users found the app overwhelming due to the abundance of features, making it difficult for them to find what they were looking for. For example, the screenshot showed a cluttered page with numerous buttons, and most users had to scroll at least once to reach the content shelf.
Here are some feedback from our survey and research â†“
> Buttons should be easier to navigate

> There is better platform for streaming content

> App should improve reliability

Once we had identified the pain points experienced by our users, we set our project goals. Our primary objective was to address the lack of a community feature within the app, providing users with a space to engage with others who share their interests. Our secondary goal was to enhance the app's usability, making it easier for users to navigate and locate the features they need.
