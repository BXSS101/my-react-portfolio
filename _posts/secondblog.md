# TrueID Connect

Are you curious about the creative process that goes into developing a successful project? Join me on a journey as I share my experience working on **TrueID Connect** during my time at the **True Academy** Internship Program 2022.

True Academy is an internship program that offers students from diverse academic backgrounds the opportunity to collaborate on their own projects and partner with a selected business unit within the company. During my two-month internship at True Academy, my team collaborated with the Corporate Strategy unit to explore ways to make the TrueID application more accessible and engaging. We identified an opportunity to create a social platform where users can discuss content from the app and other topics, and also proposed a redesign of the app to focus on entertainment content.

## EP.1 Understanding Users

![ComparePhoto](https://github.com/BXSS101/my-react-portfolio/blob/main/photo/TrueID/compare_old.jpg?raw=true)

During our user research, we discovered that while the TrueID app offered a plethora of features, not all users found them equally useful or easy to navigate. Some users found the app overwhelming due to the abundance of features, making it difficult for them to find what they were looking for. For example, the screenshot showed a cluttered page with numerous buttons, and most users had to scroll at least once to reach the content shelf.
Here are some feedback from our survey and research â†“

## EP.2 Our Goal & Idea
One of our primary goals was to incorporate a community function that allows users to watch content from the app together with their friends, similar to screen sharing features in platforms like Google Meet or Discord. However, it is important to emphasize that we will ensure that this feature is implemented in a legal and appropriate manner.
![KeyFeatureLofi](https://github.com/BXSS101/my-react-portfolio/blob/main/photo/TrueID/lofi_newfeat.jpg?raw=true)
To achieve our first goal, we developed an idea called "Watch Party," which allows users to watch content together with their friends, similar to screen-sharing in platforms like Google Meet or Discord. Our team decided to rename this feature from "Watch Room" to "Watch Party," as we felt the latter sounded more appropriate. We believe that this feature will significantly increase user engagement and encourage more users to subscribe to the app, ultimately benefiting the company. Additionally, we also developed a feature called "Movie Mix," which will enable users to discover new content and watch it with their friends in a social setting.

Our **Watch Party** feature allows users to watch content together in a private room with friends or join public rooms with many people. This feature provides more opportunities for influencer-led events and enhances user engagement. It works similarly to live chat, but with more customization options and features. With Watch Party, we expect to increase monthly active users and provide a more interactive and enjoyable experience for our users.

The **Movie Mix** feature is designed to match users with others who share the same movie genre interests. By recommending movies based on those interests, users can discover new movies to try. Additionally, Movie Mix creates a community forum where users can communicate and discuss their shared interests. This feature enhances user engagement and encourages community building within the app.

## EP.3 Design
![MainPageLofi](https://github.com/BXSS101/my-react-portfolio/blob/main/photo/TrueID/lofi_main.jpg?raw=true)
After conceptualizing the new features, we recognized the opportunity to make a significant impact on our users by redesigning the app with a fresh look, focused on improving navigation and enhancing user-friendliness. As an illustration, we have provided a glimpse of the Lofi Wireframe showcasing the five main pages of the app. This redesign aims to elevate the overall user experience and ensure a seamless journey throughout the app.
![compareToday](https://github.com/BXSS101/my-react-portfolio/blob/main/photo/TrueID/compare_today.jpg?raw=true)
This visual demonstrates a comparison between the current version of the app (depicted on the left), the lofi wireframe (in the middle), and the prototype version (on the right). In our redesign, we made notable changes to enhance the user experience. Notably, we moved the prominent banner to the top of the page to increase visual appeal. Additionally, we streamlined the menu by reducing the number of buttons from 10 to 5, resulting in a cleaner and more intuitive layout. Moreover, we strategically placed recommended content adjacent to the main section to capture user attention and encourage content consumption. These modifications aim to create a more engaging and user-friendly app interface.
![compareWatch](https://github.com/BXSS101/my-react-portfolio/blob/main/photo/TrueID/compare_watchh.jpg?raw=true)
In the Watch page, we introduced a trending movie banner to highlight the currently popular movies or series. To enhance the user experience, we relocated the sub menu to a lower position and organized it into four categorized buttons. Two of these buttons focus on movies and live TV, while the other two showcase content recommendations generated by the app in real-time.

Additionally, we integrated a dedicated section to showcase the Watch Party feature. This section provides users with information about ongoing parties, including the number of participants and the progress of the movie being watched. This allows users to make informed decisions about joining a Watch Party, particularly if the movie is nearing its conclusion.

These updates aim to provide users with a more engaging and personalized viewing experience while making it easier to navigate and discover content within the app.
![compareNav](https://github.com/BXSS101/my-react-portfolio/blob/main/photo/TrueID/compare_nav.jpg?raw=true)
As part of our redesign efforts, we made additional changes to the main menu buttons. We increased the size of the icons to improve visibility and user interaction. Furthermore, we incorporated the app's key color into the design to enhance visual consistency and brand recognition. The "Community" button was replaced with "Connect" to better represent our connect feature, emphasizing the ability for users to connect with others who share similar interests. Additionally, the last menu button was expanded to provide access to more functions within the app and also recommend other apps from True Corporation. These alterations aim to create a more visually appealing and user-friendly interface, ensuring seamless navigation and a cohesive user experience.

Will those feature work?, Does user like it?, How it will be improve?

To be continue.

**Spoiler Alert!** They really like it and I got top performer award from my internship.
