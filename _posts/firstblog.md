  Explore how me and my team solve a problem about when you want to do some
  activities but you don't want to do it alone, so we want our user to be able
  to find someone to do activities with them so they don't have to do it alone
  anymore.

## EP.1 Pain Point

The phrase that catalyzed my current train of thought was, **"Fine, I can do it alone as always."** This occurred when I invited some friends to a buffet, and they were unable to join me. Subsequently, I conducted some informal interviews with several individuals, who corroborated that they, too, have experienced a similar problem. Moreover, some of them expressed that they dislike engaging in activities alone, as it makes them feel isolated.

The root cause of this issue appears to stem from the challenges that arise when attempting to coordinate schedules with friends. It can be challenging to find a mutually agreeable time slot when everyone is available simultaneously.

## EP.2 Brainstorming

Upon identifying our shared pain point, we proceeded to discuss potential solutions. One scenario we explored involved participating in a sport that lacked the company of friends. To illustrate our thought process, we utilized an empathy map, a tool that helps to capture the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of a particular persona or target audience.
![TUM Empathy Map](https://github.com/BXSS101/my-react-portfolio/blob/main/photo/TUM/UXUI%202_64%20CE%20%5B%20Project%20III%20%5D%20G1_Page_05.jpg?raw=true)
In the example scenario provided, the user invited a friend to try wakeboarding together, but the friend was either inexperienced or unfamiliar with the sport. As a result, the friend declined the invitation, leaving the user with little to no company to partake in this activity.

This situation highlights a common challenge that many individuals face when trying to engage in activities that require specialized skills or knowledge. In response, we considered a variety of potential solutions that could help the user to still enjoy wakeboarding, such as seeking out group lessons or connecting with other individuals who share an interest in the sport. By exploring these options, we aimed to provide the user with a sense of community and support, even if they do not have friends who are able to participate in wakeboarding with them.

This image depicts a brainstorming session in which we generated ideas for addressing various challenges using the "How might we" approach. After generating and evaluating several ideas, we selected the top 4 solutions that we believe have the greatest potential for success.
- How might we have friends to do activity together?
- How might we find someone to share buy 3 get 4 promotion together?
- How might we find friends to do activities from nearby?
- How might we find someone new?

## EP.3 Design

Following the ideation phase, we arrived at the concept of an event and join platform, which would enable users to create events and allow others to join them, or alternatively, join existing events created by other users.

To make this platform user-friendly and accessible, we would need to design an intuitive interface that allows users to easily create and manage events, as well as browse and join events created by others. The platform could also incorporate features such as chat functionality, which would enable users to communicate with one another and coordinate event details in real-time.

By providing a centralized platform for event creation and participation, we believe that our concept has the potential to foster a sense of community and help individuals connect with like-minded people who share similar interests and hobbies.

This wireframe shows that the main functions are for users to browse existing events or create their own. Users can customize the event name, date and time, location, description, and maximum number of participants according to their preferences.
![TUM FLOW1](https://github.com/BXSS101/my-react-portfolio/blob/main/photo/TUM/tum_flow1.jpg?raw=true)
The higher fidelity wireframe represents the primary flow for users who wish to browse and join events. It provides a more detailed visual representation of the user journey, illustrating the key steps involved in browsing and joining events on the platform.
![TUM FLOW2](https://github.com/BXSS101/my-react-portfolio/blob/main/photo/TUM/tum_flow2.jpg?raw=true)
The subsequent flow pertains to the process of creating an event, enabling other users to join. This flow is designed to provide a seamless user experience, outlining the key steps involved in creating an event and ensuring that the event details are easily accessible to potential participants.
![TUM FLOW3](https://github.com/BXSS101/my-react-portfolio/blob/main/photo/TUM/tum_flow3.jpg?raw=true)
Subsequently, the user flow pertains to the process of browsing events on the map and joining them. This flow is designed to facilitate a seamless user experience, enabling users to easily browse events that are happening in their vicinity and join those that align with their interests and availability.

## EP.4 Improvement

Based on our analysis of the design, we have identified several areas for improvement that can enhance the overall functionality and usability of the application for example
- Add chat function to chat within event group.
- Add reminder function, so user don't forget upcoming event.
