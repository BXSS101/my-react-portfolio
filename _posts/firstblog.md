  Explore how me and my team solve a problem about when you want to do some
  activities but you don't want to do it alone, so we want our user to be able
  to find someone to do activities with them so they don't have to do it alone
  anymore.

## EP.1 Pain Point

**"Fine I can do it alone as alway."** is the sentence that get my idea started it happen when I ask my friends out for a buffet, and they can't go with me. So I started interviewing some people and they said they have this problem too, and some of them say they actually doesn't like to do anything by himself/herself that's make them feel alone. Causes of this problem, mostly start when you want to hangout with friends and some of them not free on the same period so it's hard to find the same free slot together.

## EP.2 Brainstorming

After knowing you're so pain point, we discuss about what if there is a scenario when we want to do a sport that doesn't have any friend to do it together and we think of this example Empathy map.
![TUM Empathy Map](https://github.com/BXSS101/my-react-portfolio/blob/main/photo/TUM/UXUI%202_64%20CE%20%5B%20Project%20III%20%5D%20G1_Page_05.jpg?raw=true)
From our example scenario a user ask friend out to try Wakeboard together and a friend doesn't know how to play it or not many friends know how to play this sport, so the one who doesn't know how to play decide not to go with him/her, that means our user doesn't have so much company or maybe doesn't have any at all.

From this photo, it's when we're brainstorming about how might we in many situations and here are our top 4 ideas.
- How might we have friends to do activity together?
- How might we find someone to share buy 3 get 4 promotion together?
- How might we find friends to do activities from nearby?
- How might we find someone new?

## EP.3 Design

After we got the idea of event & join, our users must create an event to allow other people to join their event or they can joint other existing event.
![TUM LOFI](https://github.com/BXSS101/my-react-portfolio/blob/main/photo/TUM/tum_lofi.jpg?raw=true)
From this wireframe shows that I can browse events, or can create event by themself.
