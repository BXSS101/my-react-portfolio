  Explore how me and my team solve a problem about when you want to do some
  activities but you don't want to do it alone, so we want our user to be able

## EP.1 Pain Point

**"Fine I can do it alone as alway."** is the sentence that get my idea started it happen when I ask my friends out for a buffet, and they can't go with me. So I started interviewing some people and they said they have this problem too, and some of them say they actually doesn't like to do anything by himself/herself that's make them feel alone. Causes of this problem, mostly start when you want to hangout with friends and some of them not free on the same period so it's hard to find the same free slot together.

## EP.2 Brainstorming

After knowing you're so pain point, we discuss about what if there is a scenario when we want to do a sport that doesn't have any friend to do it together and we think of this example Empathy map.
![TUM Empathy Map](https://github.com/BXSS101/my-react-portfolio/blob/main/photo/TUM/UXUI%202_64%20CE%20%5B%20Project%20III%20%5D%20G1_Page_05.jpg?raw=true)
From our example scenario a user ask friend out to try Wakeboard together and a friend doesn't know how to play it or not many friends know how to play this sport, so the one who doesn't know how to play decide not to go with him/her, that means our user doesn't have so much company or maybe doesn't have any at all.

From this photo, it's when we're brainstorming about how might we in many situations and here are our top 4 ideas.
- How might we have friends to do activity together?
- How might we find someone to share buy 3 get 4 promotion together?
- How might we find friends to do activities from nearby?
- How might we find someone new?

## EP.3 Design

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.


## BLockquote

> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
