This first work for me is after me and my team been elected to be Student Committee of Academic year 2018 and I was assign as head of PR. It's the  first of many events that we organize at our school. This event is an event for senior year students when it's close to their graduation of academic year 2017 and we call it **"จากเหย้า"** also all Suankularb named school have this event too. Goal of this poster is to invite all the students to attend this event by the time and location in this poster.
## Academic Year 2018
Next event is The Orientation camp for new grade 7 students, they just graduate from primary school and at this camp we make the transformation easier by getting to know how secondary school is and teach what's mandatory for study in this school and my job as PR is speak to public that we have this interesting camp and it's coming pretty soon.

After that it's open day for everyone to get back to school and study at that time a movie called Avangers Infinity War is in theater and it's trending that Thanos (Character in the movie) snap his finger and half of universe's population will be vanish into dust. I use that idea to represent that summer break is about to over and it's vanishing.
