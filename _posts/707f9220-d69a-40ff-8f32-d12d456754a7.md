This first work for me is after me and my team been elected to be Student Committee of Academic year 2018 and I was assign as head of PR. It's the  first of many events that we organize at our school. This event is an event for senior year students when it's close to their graduation of academic year 2017 and we call it **"จากเหย้า"** also all Suankularb named school have this event too. Goal of this poster is to invite all the students to attend this event by the time and location in this poster.

After that it's open day for everyone to get back to school and study at that time a movie called Avangers Infinity War is in theater and it's trending that Thanos (Character in the movie) snap his finger and half of universe's population will be vanish into dust. I use that idea to represent that summer break is about to over and it's vanishing.

Before the start of the second semester, there was a popular movie in theaters called "Homestay." We decided to leverage this trend for our open day announcement, and as a result, we created the following poster.

As we approach the end of the academic year, the election for the next student committee group is just around the corner. To encourage students to run for candidacy, we have designed a captivating poster for candidate recruitment. This poster aims to attract potential candidates and inspire them to take an active role in shaping the future of our student community.

During our efforts to create the 2018 yearbook, we organized a special photoshoot for all senior students. To convey the essence of minimalism and evoke a sense of nostalgia, we opted for a unique approach. The picture was carefully selected to showcase an unseen view within our school, complemented by a clean white background that mimics the appearance of a polaroid photo, symbolizing the essence of capturing memories.

To communicate the upcoming photoshoot effectively, we utilized a handwritten-style font and kept the text minimal. This created a warm and personal touch, inviting all seniors to join in the photoshoot on the following day. Through this innovative approach, we aimed to encourage maximum participation and create lasting memories for our yearbook.
